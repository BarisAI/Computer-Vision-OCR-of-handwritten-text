Selected problem: OCR of handwritten text (word-level recognition).

Selected dataset: IAM Handwriting Database (word images with ground-truth transcriptions).
Brief description: We will build a neural network-based OCR system to recognize handwritten words from the IAM dataset. We will use transfer learning with a CNN encoder and a lightweight recognition head. To meet the project requirements and improve performance, we will implement the following:
Preprocessing: Resizing and padding images to meet the minimum input size requirements (200x200px).
Data Augmentation: Applying random rotations and shifts to increase dataset diversity.
Training: We will use a Learning Rate Scheduler (Adaptive Hyperparameters) to optimize training.
Tools: We will use Tensorboard or Weights & Biases for logging experiments and visualizing training metrics. The project will also include a standard train/validation/test split and evaluation using at least two metrics.
